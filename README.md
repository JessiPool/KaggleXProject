# Kaggle X Cohort 3 Project 
# This project is intended to model the availability of affordable housing in the United States using several economic factors. These factors include the consumer price index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP), the Dow Jones industrial average, as well as student aid and health care cost indicators.
# The goal is to create a model of affordable housing availability using categorization and regression tools.
# The data has been exported to BigQuery, and the analysis is being conducted using SQL and Python (Google Colab).
