These factors include the consumer price index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP), the Dow Jones industrial average, as well as student aid and health care cost indicators. 
# The goal is to create a model of affordable housing availability using logistic regression analysis.
# The data has been exported to BigQuery, and the analysis is being conducted using SQL and Python (Google Colab).
