# Kaggle X Cohort 3 Project: 
# Affordable Housing Availability in the United States
## Jessica Pool, PhD

This project is intended to model the availability of affordable housing in the United States using several economic factors. These factors include the consumer price index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP), the Dow Jones industrial average, as well as student aid and health care cost indicators. The goal was to create a model of affordable housing availability using categorization and regression tools. The data was exported to BigQuery, and the analysis was conducted using SQL and Python (Google Colab).

Through a series of exploring and evaluating several models using various methods, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) with Random Forest regressor appears to generate the best fit.
