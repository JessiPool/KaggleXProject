# KaggleXProject
# Kaggle X Cohort 3 Project 
# This project is intended to model the availability of affordable housing in the United States. 
# The plan is to use linear regression analysis to determine what economic factors affect affordability, create a time series, and hopefully, a forecasting model.
# The data has been exported to BigQuery, and the analysis is being done using SQL and Python.
